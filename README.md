# Mission To Mars

## Background

Robin's web app is looking good and functioning well, but she wants to add more polish to it. She had been admiring images of Mars’s hemispheres online and realized that the site is scraping-friendly. She would like to adjust the current web app to include all four of the hemisphere images. To do this, you’ll use BeautifulSoup and Splinter to scrape full-resolution images of Mars’s hemispheres and the titles of those images, store the scraped data on a Mongo database, use a web application to display the data, and alter the design of the web app to accommodate these images.

Robin, who loves astronomy and wants to work for NASA one day, has decided to use a specific method of gathering the latest data: web scraping. Using this technique, she has the ability to pull data from multiple websites, store it in a database, then present the collected data in a central location: a webpage (Figure 1).

The data Robin wants to collect from this particular website is the most recent news article along with its summary. 

The code for this will eventually be used in an application that will scrape live data with the click of a button—this site is dynamic and the articles will change frequently, which is why Robin is removing the manual task of retrieving each new article.
